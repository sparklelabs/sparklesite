&nbsp;   

The *Little Free Solar Library* is a small, solar-powered device that creates a local, offline digital library. It broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal, allowing people nearby to connect and access  local flora &amp; fauna information, field recordings, environmental data, and civic information, local resources, zines, and instructions on how to build your solar library. No internet required. It’s designed to be simple, easy to make, and powered by the sun.

With open-source plans, this library can be built with just a few parts, and it runs entirely off-grid. It’s a chance for people to learn how to build their own solar-powered device, share knowledge, and connect with others in the community.
