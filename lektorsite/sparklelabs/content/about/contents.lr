Sparkle Labs began making approachable educational electronics kits in 2008. Used by K-12 schools, universities, artists, engineers, vocational schools, hobbyists and more, the kits have assisted thousands of children and adults in their curiosity about the creative and technical aspects of science.
  
The company&#8217;s flagship kit, [_Discover Electronics_](/shop/discover-electronics), was inspired by the founders&#8217; involvement with the early issues of [_Make Magazine_](https://makezine.com/), when the pair quickly recognized a need for educational tools to get aspirational makers up and running. With an assembly line consisting of helpful friends and family, Sparkle Labs filled its initial run of electronics kits. When the couple received an order too large to fill in their Manhattan apartment, they contracted a professional manufacturer and converted the endeavor into a real business. Since then, Sparkle Labs has grown in size and mission, maintaining an organic passion for providing knowledge and sparking creativity.
