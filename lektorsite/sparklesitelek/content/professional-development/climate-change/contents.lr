### Goals

- Give teachers tools to create lessons for NJSLS climate standards.
- Review lessons Sparkle Labs has created that are applicable to the climate standards.
- Teach the use and application of the *Watt Meter.*
- Create a structured design workshop environment to allow the teachers to work together on the climate standards.

### Watt Meter

- [Instructions](/products/watt-meter/wattmeter-instructions.pdf)
- Application
- Lesson

Materials: wattmeter, electric bill, extension cords, powerstrips, appliances, laptop charger, water heater, lamp (incandescent, LED)

### Electric Bill Analysis

- Reading your bill
- Downloading your energy usage data.
- Manipulating data in google sheets

- [Sample energy bill]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aInHunuYTFA099avDeo0QzoIQnhex-MB/view?usp=drive_link )

#### Notes

cost per kWh = *price to compare* + delivery charges
.184989 for me

##### Explaining electric charges

We charge for the electric you use in kilowatt
hours (kWh). 1 kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts.
If you use a standard LCD TV which uses
150 watts while operating, it would take
7 hours of use to equal 1 kWh.

### Design Charette

**Materials:** prompt hand-outs, post-its, sharpies, laptop, shared google doc

**Goal:** Develop lesson plans for NJSLS *performance expectations*

**Part 1:** Groups of 4-5 will conduct a structured brainstorming session on individual NJSLS items.
  1. Individuals brainstorm silently. Ideas are written on individal post-its.
  2. Group members work together to classify and group the ideas.
  3. Silent voting on ideas for a lesson.
  4. Group outlines a rough lesson based on the chosen idea(s)

**Part 2:** The groups will rotate in a *world cafe* framework to give feedback on rough lesson plans.

**Part 3:** Groups reform to action any feedback. 

**Part 4:** Presentation of lesson outlines
